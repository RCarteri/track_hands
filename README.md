# Project 4 AI: Hand Tracking

## Description
This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking using a webcam and the `cvzone` library, which leverages `MediaPipe` and `OpenCV`. The application detects and tracks hands in the video feed from the webcam.

## Requirements
- Python
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
- cvzone

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have a working webcam connected to your computer.
2. Install the required libraries using the commands mentioned in the Installation section.
3. Run the code in a Python environment.

The application will start capturing video from your webcam and display the video feed with hand tracking overlaid. The application will close when any key is pressed.

## Notes
- `detectionCon` parameter in `HandDetector` specifies the confidence threshold for detecting hands.
- `maxHands` parameter specifies the maximum number of hands to detect.
